# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Implementation

A comprehensive implementation of Artificial Neural Networks for binary classification tasks.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras. ANNs are the foundation of deep learning and are inspired by biological neural networks.

## What is an Artificial Neural Network?

An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

### Key Components:

1. **Input Layer**: Receives the input features
2. **Hidden Layers**: Process information through weighted connections
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction
4. **Weights**: Connection strengths between neurons
5. **Bias**: Offset values for each neuron
6. **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)

## Architecture

```
Input Layer (20 features)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 1 (64 neurons, ReLU) + Dropout(0.2)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 2 (32 neurons, ReLU) + Dropout(0.2)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 3 (16 neurons, ReLU)
    ↓
Output Layer (1 neuron, Sigmoid)
```

## Topics Covered

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling with StandardScaler
   - Train-test split
   - Data normalization

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Sequential model design
   - Dense (fully connected) layers
   - Dropout for regularization

3. **Activation Functions**
   - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for hidden layers
   - Sigmoid for binary classification output

4. **Training**
   - Adam optimizer
   - Binary crossentropy loss
   - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
   - Batch training

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy metrics
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report
   - Training/validation curves

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

```bash
cd Implementation/ANN
jupyter notebook ANN.ipynb
```

## Dataset

This implementation uses a synthetic dataset generated with `make_classification` for demonstration. You can replace it with your own dataset:

- **Features**: 20 input features
- **Samples**: 10,000 data points
- **Classes**: Binary (0 or 1)
- **Task**: Binary classification

### Using Your Own Dataset

Replace the data loading section with:

```python
# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Prepare features and target
X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1).values
y = df['target_column'].values
```

## Model Performance

The model typically achieves:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~90-95%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~85-90%
- **Training Time**: 2-5 minutes (depending on hardware)

## Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Hidden Layers | 3 | Number of hidden layers |
| Neurons | 64, 32, 16 | Neurons in each hidden layer |
| Activation | ReLU | Activation function for hidden layers |
| Output Activation | Sigmoid | Binary classification |
| Optimizer | Adam | Adaptive learning rate optimizer |
| Loss Function | Binary Crossentropy | For binary classification |
| Dropout Rate | 0.2 | Regularization to prevent overfitting |
| Batch Size | 32 | Samples per gradient update |
| Epochs | 100 | Maximum training iterations |
| Early Stopping | Yes | Stops when validation loss stops improving |

## Key Concepts

### 1. Forward Propagation
- Input data flows through the network
- Each layer applies weights, bias, and activation
- Produces output prediction

### 2. Backpropagation
- Calculates gradient of loss with respect to weights
- Updates weights to minimize loss
- Uses chain rule from calculus

### 3. Gradient Descent
- Optimization algorithm to minimize loss
- Adam optimizer: adaptive learning rate
- Converges faster than standard SGD

### 4. Regularization Techniques
- **Dropout**: Randomly drops neurons during training
- **Early Stopping**: Stops training when validation loss increases
- Prevents overfitting to training data

## Activation Functions

### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
```
f(x) = max(0, x)
```
- Most popular for hidden layers
- Solves vanishing gradient problem
- Fast computation

### Sigmoid
```
f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
```
- Used for binary classification output
- Outputs probability between 0 and 1

## When to Use ANN

### Good Use Cases:
- Binary or multi-class classification
- Regression problems
- Pattern recognition in tabular data
- Customer churn prediction
- Credit risk assessment
- Medical diagnosis

### When NOT to Use:
- Image data (use CNN instead)
- Sequential/time-series data (use RNN/LSTM instead)
- Small datasets (use traditional ML)
- When interpretability is critical

## Advantages

1. **Flexible**: Can model complex non-linear relationships
2. **Scalable**: Works with large datasets
3. **Versatile**: Applicable to various problem types
4. **Adaptive**: Learns from data automatically

## Limitations

1. **Data Hungry**: Requires large amounts of training data
2. **Computational**: Can be slow to train
3. **Black Box**: Difficult to interpret decisions
4. **Overfitting**: Can memorize training data
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Requires experimentation

## Best Practices

1. **Normalize your data**: Use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
2. **Use dropout**: Prevents overfitting
3. **Early stopping**: Monitor validation loss
4. **Start simple**: Begin with fewer layers, add complexity
5. **Batch normalization**: Stabilizes training
6. **Learning rate scheduling**: Adjust learning rate over time

## Comparison with Other Algorithms

| Feature | ANN | Logistic Regression | Decision Trees |
|---------|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| Complexity | High | Low | Medium |
| Interpretability | Low | High | High |
| Training Time | Slow | Fast | Fast |
| Performance | Excellent | Good | Good |
| Data Requirements | Large | Small-Medium | Small-Medium |
