## The Four Models

The notebook compares these four regression approaches:

| Model | Type | Regularization | Key Characteristic |
|-------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Linear Regression (OLS)** | Baseline | None | Simple, interpretable |
| **Ridge Regression** | Regularized | L2 (Alpha penalty) | Handles multicollinearity |
| **Lasso Regression** | Regularized | L1 (Alpha penalty) | Automatic feature selection |
| **ElasticNet** | Regularized | L1 + L2 (Combined) | Best of both worlds |

---

## Model Comparison Methodology

### Section 16: Model Comparison (Cells 61-63)

The comparison follows this structured approach:

1. **Train Best Models**: Each model is trained with its optimal hyperparameters
   - Ridge: Best alpha from [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]
   - Lasso: Best alpha from [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]
   - ElasticNet: Best combination of alpha and l1_ratio from grid search

2. **Evaluate on Test Set**: All models are evaluated using the same test data

3. **Compare Metrics**: Side-by-side comparison of performance metrics

4. **Visualize Results**: Bar charts showing relative performance

---

## Evaluation Metrics

All models are evaluated using four key metrics:

### 1. R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Meaning**: Proportion of variance explained by the model
- **Interpretation**:
  - R² = 0.85 means the model explains 85% of the variance
  - R² = 1.0 means perfect predictions

### 2. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **Range**: 0 to ∞ (lower is better)
- **Meaning**: Average prediction error in the same units as target variable
- **Interpretation**:
  - RMSE = $2,000 means predictions are off by ~$2,000 on average
  - More sensitive to large errors (due to squaring)

### 3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- **Range**: 0 to ∞ (lower is better)
- **Meaning**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values
- **Interpretation**:
  - MAE = $1,500 means average error is $1,500
  - Less sensitive to outliers than RMSE

### 4. MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- **Range**: 0 to ∞ (lower is better)
- **Meaning**: Average squared difference (before taking square root)
- **Use**: Foundation for RMSE calculation

**Note**: All metrics are calculated for both training and test sets to detect overfitting.

## Detailed Model Explanations

### 1. Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares - OLS)

**Location**: Cell 41-42

#### How It Works
- Minimizes the sum of squared residuals: `min Σ(y - ŷ)²`
- Finds the best-fit line/hyperplane through the data
- No regularization or penalty terms

#### Mathematical Formula
```
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε
```

Where:
- y = predicted car price
- β₀ = intercept
- β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ = coefficients for each feature
- ε = error term

#### Strengths
- **Simple and interpretable**: Coefficients directly show feature impact
- **Fast to train**: No hyperparameter tuning needed
- **Unbiased**: Coefficients are unbiased estimators
- **Baseline model**: Good starting point for comparison

#### Weaknesses
- **Prone to overfitting**: Especially with many features
- **Multicollinearity issues**: Unstable when features are correlated
- **No feature selection**: Uses all features regardless of importance
- **Sensitive to outliers**: Large errors heavily influence the fit

#### When to Use
- Small to medium number of features (< 50)
- Features are not highly correlated
- Interpretability is critical
- As a baseline to compare against

---

### 2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

**Location**: Cells 52-54

#### How It Works
- Adds L2 penalty to OLS: `min Σ(y - ŷ)² + α Σβ²`
- Shrinks coefficients toward zero (but never exactly to zero)
- Hyperparameter α controls regularization strength

#### Mathematical Formula
```
Cost = Σ(y - ŷ)² + α Σβ²
```

Where:
- α (alpha) = regularization strength
- Higher α → more regularization → smaller coefficients

#### Alpha Values Tested
- [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]
- Visualized as R² vs Alpha curve

#### Strengths
- **Handles multicollinearity**: Stabilizes coefficients when features correlate
- **Prevents overfitting**: Regularization reduces model complexity
- **Keeps all features**: Useful when all features have some relevance
- **Smooth coefficient paths**: Small changes in data → small changes in coefficients

#### Weaknesses
- **No feature selection**: All features remain in the model
- **Less interpretable**: Coefficients are biased toward zero
- **Requires tuning**: Need to find optimal α value
- **May underfit**: Too much regularization can hurt performance

#### When to Use
- High multicollinearity (correlated features)
- Many features that may all be relevant
- Model needs to be stable and robust
- Feature selection is NOT required

---

### 3. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

**Location**: Cells 55-57

#### How It Works
- Adds L1 penalty to OLS: `min Σ(y - ŷ)² + α Σ|β|`
- Can shrink coefficients exactly to zero
- Performs automatic feature selection

#### Mathematical Formula
```
Cost = Σ(y - ŷ)² + α Σ|β|
```

Where:
- α (alpha) = regularization strength
- Higher α → more features eliminated (β = 0)

#### Alpha Values Tested
- [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]
- Shows number of features selected at each α

#### Strengths
- **Automatic feature selection**: Eliminates irrelevant features
- **Sparse models**: Easier to interpret with fewer features
- **Prevents overfitting**: Reduces model complexity
- **Improved performance**: Can outperform OLS with many features

#### Weaknesses
- **Arbitrary selection**: May randomly choose one from correlated features
- **Unstable with high correlation**: Different runs may select different features
- **May eliminate important features**: If α is too high
- **Requires tuning**: Need to find optimal α value

#### When to Use
- Many features, but only some are important
- Feature selection is desired
- Want a simpler, more interpretable model
- Dataset has high dimensionality

---

### 4. ElasticNet Regression (L1 + L2 Regularization)

**Location**: Cells 58-60

#### How It Works
- Combines L1 and L2 penalties: `min Σ(y - ŷ)² + α(l1_ratio×Σ|β| + (1-l1_ratio)×Σβ²)`
- Balances feature selection (L1) and multicollinearity handling (L2)
- Two hyperparameters: α and l1_ratio

#### Mathematical Formula
```
Cost = Σ(y - ŷ)² + α × [l1_ratio × Σ|β| + (1-l1_ratio)/2 × Σβ²]
```

Where:
- α = overall regularization strength
- l1_ratio = balance between L1 and L2
  - l1_ratio = 1.0 → Pure Lasso
  - l1_ratio = 0.0 → Pure Ridge
  - l1_ratio = 0.5 → Equal mix

#### Parameters Tested (Grid Search)
- **Alpha**: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]
- **L1_ratio**: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]
- **Total combinations**: 5 × 5 = 25
- Visualized as a heatmap

#### Strengths
- **Best of both worlds**: Feature selection + multicollinearity handling
- **More stable than Lasso**: Better with correlated features
- **Flexible**: Can tune toward Ridge or Lasso behavior
- **Group selection**: Tends to select groups of correlated features

#### Weaknesses
- **More complex tuning**: Two hyperparameters to optimize
- **Computationally expensive**: Grid search over 2D parameter space
- **Less interpretable**: More complex regularization scheme
- **May be overkill**: Sometimes simpler models suffice

#### When to Use
- High multicollinearity AND need feature selection
- Correlated features that should be selected together
- Dataset has both irrelevant features and correlated predictors
- Want the most robust model regardless of complexity

## Model Comparison Results

### Section 16: Performance Metrics Comparison (Cells 62-63)

The notebook compares all four models using:

1. **R² Score Comparison**
   - Bar chart showing R² for each model
   - Identifies which model explains variance best

2. **RMSE Comparison**
   - Lower RMSE indicates better predictions
   - Shows prediction error in dollar terms

3. **MAE Comparison**
   - Average absolute error for each model
   - Less sensitive to outliers than RMSE

### Typical Findings

In most car price prediction scenarios:

| Model | Expected Performance | Why |
|-------|---------------------|-----|
| **Linear Regression** | Baseline (good) | Simple, but may overfit |
| **Ridge** | Slightly better | Handles correlated features |
| **Lasso** | Best or tied | Removes irrelevant features |
| **ElasticNet** | Best or tied | Combines best of both |

**Note**: Results vary based on:
- Dataset characteristics
- Feature correlations
- Number of features
- Optimal hyperparameters found

## Feature Importance Comparison

### Section 17: Feature Importance Across Models (Cells 64-66)

This section compares how different models weight features:

### What's Compared
1. **Coefficient magnitudes**: How important each feature is to each model
2. **Feature selection**: Which features are kept vs eliminated
3. **Top features**: Most influential features for each model

### Key Insights

#### Linear Regression (OLS)
- **All coefficients present**: Uses every feature
- **Large magnitudes**: May have very large positive/negative coefficients
- **Unstable**: Coefficients can be unreliable if features correlate

#### Ridge Regression
- **All coefficients present**: Shrunk but not eliminated
- **Smaller magnitudes**: More conservative estimates
- **Stable**: Coefficients are more reliable

#### Lasso Regression
- **Sparse coefficients**: Many coefficients are exactly 0
- **Feature selection evident**: Only important features remain
- **Top features**: Shows which features truly matter

#### ElasticNet
- **Moderate sparsity**: Some features eliminated, but less aggressive than Lasso
- **Grouped selection**: Correlated features selected together
- **Balanced**: Combines stability of Ridge with selection of Lasso

### Visualization

The notebook creates a **coefficient comparison plot** showing:
- Top 15 features for each model
- Side-by-side coefficient bars
- Which features are eliminated by Lasso/ElasticNet
- How regularization affects feature weights

## When to Use Each Model

### Decision Framework (From Section 18: Cells 86-95)

#### Use Linear Regression (OLS) When:
- ✅ Number of features is small to moderate (< 50)
- ✅ Features are NOT highly correlated
- ✅ Interpretability is critical
- ✅ You need unbiased coefficient estimates
- ✅ Dataset is clean with no multicollinearity
- ✅ You want a simple baseline model

**Example**: Predicting house prices with 10 well-chosen, independent features

---

#### Use Ridge Regression When:
- ✅ Features are highly correlated (multicollinearity)
- ✅ You want to keep all features
- ✅ Model stability is important
- ✅ Preventing overfitting is a concern
- ✅ You have more features than samples (p > n)
- ✅ All features are believed to be relevant

**Example**: Predicting car prices where engine size, horsepower, and cylinders are correlated

---

#### Use Lasso Regression When:
- ✅ Many features, but only some are important
- ✅ You want automatic feature selection
- ✅ Model simplicity is valued
- ✅ You need a sparse model (few features)
- ✅ You want to identify key predictors
- ✅ Interpretability with fewer features is desired

**Example**: Predicting prices with 100 features, but only 20 are truly relevant

---

#### Use ElasticNet When:
- ✅ High multicollinearity AND need feature selection
- ✅ Correlated features should be selected together
- ✅ Lasso is too unstable (correlated features)
- ✅ You want robustness over simplicity
- ✅ Dataset has both irrelevant and correlated features
- ✅ You're willing to tune two hyperparameters

**Example**: Predicting prices with 200 features that are correlated in groups, with some groups irrelevant
